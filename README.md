### 42 Network ðŸ”’
You must be a 42 Network student to access the app (as secret keys are provided by the 42 intranet).

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have Expo CLI installed. If not, you can install it by running:
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
Next, install the project dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Create Environment File**

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project with the following content:

   ```env
   APP_ENV_UID=u-your-uid-here
   APP_ENV_SECRET=s-your-secret-here

   API_BASE_URL=https://api.intra.42.fr

   API_GET_USER_INFOS=${API_BASE_URL}/v2/users/
   API_GET_TOKEN=${API_BASE_URL}/oauth/token/
   API_GET_USER=${API_BASE_URL}/v2/users/?filter[login]=
   API_GET_PROJECT=${API_BASE_URL}/v2/projects_users/
   ```

   Replace `u-your-uid-here` and `s-your-secret-here` with your own keys provided by your 42 intranet.

4. **Run on Device or Emulator**
```sh
npm start # Starts the npm CLI
npm start --android # Opens your app in an Android emulator or connected device
npm start --ios # Opens your app in the iOS simulator (macOS only)
npm start --web # Opens your app in a web browser
```

   Refer to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=expo-go) to configure your environment with an Android or iOS emulator, or on your own phone.
